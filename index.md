# HackVita Documentation

The purpose of the API is to be able to integrate HackVita with other external services. The APIs are very simple and intuitive, obviously the [support](https://dashboard.hackvita.eu/Chat) is always there in case of need.

### HackVita Terms

* Even by using this API, you MUST mention us in case of sharing the accounts generated. You can see TOS using [/informations/getTos](v2/getTos) method.
* You MUST NOT exceed the limit of 1r/s or you will get banned from using the API.
* We deserve the right to ban anyone from the usage of this API if we consider him not suitable to this service.

### Who can use the API?

To use this API you need to generate an api key from the panel. [Click here to see your current key or regenerate it.](https://dashboard.hackvita.eu/ApiKeys) If you need some specific function that the api doesn't integrate at the moment, contact us on support and we will try to do our best. 

### Security

Never share your API key with anyone. This way, you will give full access to the API. HackVita staff does not take any responsibility in such cases. If you share the key by mistake, revoke it immediately from your panel. **We reserve the right to save certain information and to revoke your API key immediately if we detect strange operations with the key.**
